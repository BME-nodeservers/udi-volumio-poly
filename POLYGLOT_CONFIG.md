## Configuration

To configure the Volumio node server, you must configure it for the 
Volumio media devices you wish to control. 

Enter the name and IP of each Volumio media device as a custom parameter
key / value.  I.E. 

key = MyVolumio  value = 192.168.92.3

You can enter the Volumio address as 'name.local' instead of IP address and
the node server will attempt to find the Volumio device that way.
